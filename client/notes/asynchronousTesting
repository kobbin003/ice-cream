For asynchronous testing use:
1. await
2. waitFor

1. await suffices for most cases.
   You have to use await before find queries.

e.g: await screen.findByRole('button')

2. waitFor is used for cases when there is more than one result.
   For e.g in findAll cases we are exepcting more than one result.

e.g: await waitFor(async () => {
    await screen.findAllByRole('button')
})
